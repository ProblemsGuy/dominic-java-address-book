# Address Book Challenge - Task 1

## The problems that this software will solve

- **Allow users to access an independent application to store their contacts**
- **Allow easy access of a large pool of information**
- **Save on potential error from miscommunication or misremembering**
- **Remove redundant or duplicate information**

## The benefits that the software will bring to the user

- In the modern era, we are called on to remember large amounts of random strings or numbers in order to remain in contact with people. This software will allow your users to be able to ensure they always have that information in an accessible, easy to access location at all times.
- With an editing functionality, the data is dynamic, allowing users to change it as inevitably their contacts change. Information has a half life, and with this, users will be able to simply update the content of their address book as needs be to fit the changing world.
- Through the use of a Java based terminal application, a user will be able to use this on almost any device they can get their hands on, making this an accessible, portable and easily transferable information set. This provides far more utility than even a regular Address Book, since the information can be sent between devices and access anywhere where the user has a screen and a keyboard.

## The impact that the software will have on your business

- The business will have a piece of software which provides them a useful logistical tool, being able to store and access staff and client data in an easy to access form. Gone are the days of struggling to find half recalled phone numbers or scribbled down emails, all of that information can be easily colated and placed centrally, so all have access to it.
- The data provided by an address book is also highly advantageous to any business, providing not only clients name and contact information, but also giving the business access to a mappable network. By connecting together information from different Address Books, and seeing where there is overlap and similarity, a business could create proximity maps, heat maps, relational data, know the relationships between different clients, employees or any end user. The three data points stored in this software represent the keys to a client's mind.
